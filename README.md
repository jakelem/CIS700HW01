My game is a standard fairy tale story with a twist: you start out as the heir to the throne, but your goal is to get yourself turned into a frog so that you can skirt your royal responsibilities and live out the rest of your days in a pond. Frogs are my favorite animal, and I wanted to find some way to incorporate them into my game; the classic Frog Prince fairy tale seemed like a natural starting point, and the rest followed from there. I think the urge to escape the pressures and chaos of human life by retreating to nature is a common one, so I thought it would be fun to put it into action here.
